# Code for Change - Hackathon Website

## Project Overview

Code for Change is a responsive, accessible website for a student-led hackathon focused on creating digital solutions for local community challenges. The website features comprehensive event information, an interactive registration system, and a modern dark/light theme toggle functionality. Built with semantic HTML, CSS custom properties, and vanilla JavaScript, the site emphasizes accessibility, user experience, and social impact.

## Background

This project was developed for **CodePath WEB101 Intro to Web Development Class** as part of the curriculum requirements. I chose to create a hackathon website because I'm passionate about the intersection of technology and social good. Having participated in several hackathons myself, I wanted to design a platform that would inspire students to use their coding skills for meaningful community impact, addressing issues like food insecurity, transportation access, and literacy.

The project topic resonated with me because it combines my interests in web development, community service, and education. I wanted to create something that wasn't just a technical exercise, but could genuinely serve as a template for real social impact events.
